## Welcome to Rose's Project 6!
This project worked with classes



### 4 Classes
In this project we created a rectangle class, triangle, square and shape. After testing that each of these classes worked properly, I created a block of code to test for array of side arrays. In my block of code I used a switch statement as well as ternary operator.
